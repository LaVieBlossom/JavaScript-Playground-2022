// NOTE:
/* When creating a app.js file ensure you have first created a src folder. Then within the src folder add untitled file. Call this file app.js
To open the app.js file you need to go to the src folder. So type in the terminal cd src, return. Then ls, return. This will show app.js.
Now you can go node app.js
